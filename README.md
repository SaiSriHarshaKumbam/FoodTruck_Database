# FoodTruck_Database
The repository is about a Food Truck Database that I have created for a Local Food Truck in Baltimore City. 

I made a database for a local food truck.

Database inventories information about the orders placed, employees, customer information, and menu.

Fulfills the requirement of tracking and placing orders, retrieving customer and employee information. 

Database also retrieves orders placed by customer during a certain period. 

These were the set of Business Rules for the database that I have used
Customers & employees can search through the menu and view menu items, prices, and inventory levels.

Employees can adjust menu items and prices.

Employees can put in the order.

After a purchase, the DB will update inventory levels.
